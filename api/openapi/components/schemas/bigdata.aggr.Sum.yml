      Sum the values of a given input field.

      It supports booleans, unsigned integers (output type: ulong),
      signed integers (output type: long), and double (output type: double).

      The output field is always set. It is left null if no input value is
      passed to the aggregation, either because there is no input row or because
      the input field is optional and its value is absent from each row.
    required:
      - inputFieldName
      - outputFieldName
