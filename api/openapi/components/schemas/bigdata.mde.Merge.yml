      Merge all the rows of a given input table in a single one.


      The output type is the same as the input type.


      The operation keeps the first present value of each field.


      The operation stops scanning the input rows as soon as a value has been

      found for each optional field.


      If, for a given field, no value has been found after scanning all the
      input

      rows, then the field is left unset.


      If there is no input row, then there is no output row either, hence the

      number of output rows can be either 0 or 1.
