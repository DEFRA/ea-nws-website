      This reference type inhibits \p mde_op_add_dependency. This is useful when

      implementing operations with rewrites: when referencing fields that

      would otherwise be implicit. It allows the input optimizer to remove
      fields

      even if they are explicitly mentioned in the rewritten expression.
