  Absolute anniversary period.

  This period can be defined as a whole month (in that case, \ref month is
  set accordingly). Otherwise, it can be defined as an interval of days (and
  then, \ref interval should be correctly set).

  For instance, this period is used to target the anniversary of the
  following periods:
  - the 13th of February (using \ref interval)
  - between the 28th of January and the 13th of February (using \ref interval)
  - in February (using \ref month)
