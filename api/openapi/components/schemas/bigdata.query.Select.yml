  A selection condition.

  Defines a selection on a collection.
required:
  - collection
  - cond

  collection:
    type: string
    description: |-
      Name of the collection.

      Note that a query may be done on a particular region (shard).

      To do that, the specified collection name can actually be the name
      of the targeted shard. The name of a shard follows the pattern
      "{collection_name}:{shard_identifier}" where the format of the
      {shard_identifier} is database-engine dependent.

      For QTS databases, the format is "{instanceId}@{hostId}"

      Select identifier.

      This identifier can be used to keep track of the progress of a
      selection, using the dedicated RPCs.

      If provided, it must not be used by another selection in progress.
      If not provided, a unique select identifier is generated.
