      Partition dimension.

      Group the column values by segments.

          Partition edges.


          Example: for a column containing integer values, defining a partition

          [10, 30, 70] will create 4 segments:


          - segment 0: ]-infinite, 10[

          - segment 1: [10, 30[

          - segment 2: [30, 70[

          - segment 3: [70, +infinite[


          The edges must have all have the same type, and be strictly
          increasing.

      modulo:
        description: >-
          Modulo applied to the values before looking for their segment.


          For example, if the defined partition is [10, 30, 70], and the modulo

          is set to 100, it will create 3 segments in which the values modulo
          100

          are classified:


          - segment 0: [10, 30[

          - segment 1: [30, 70[

          - segment 2: [0, 10[ U [70, 100[


          The modulo must be of the same type as the edges, and be greater than

          the last one.

          The edges must be positive.
