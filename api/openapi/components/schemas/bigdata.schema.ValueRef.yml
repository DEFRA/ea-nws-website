      Alias to \ref bigdata.ref.ValueRef, kept for backward compatibility.

      This class is provided in order to preserve backward compatibility after
      ValueRef has been moved to \ref bigdata.ref.ValueRef. This class ensures
      previous ValueRef objects can be unserialized from XML and JSON.
