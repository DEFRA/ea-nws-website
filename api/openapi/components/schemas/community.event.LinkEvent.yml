    description: >-
      Event sent to all contracts of a group when a new contract joins it.


      The new contract also receives the event.

      This event is *not* sent to the first contract of a group when the group
      is

      created. a \ref GroupCreateEvent is sent instead.

      This event is sent after a successful call to community.sdk.Contract.link.
