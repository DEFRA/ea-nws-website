      Allowed groups of service centers in a workspace.


      In any case, a workspace cannot use a group of service centers if it is
      not

      allowed in its parent.


      By default (ie. if the AVP is not present) then all the groups are
      allowed.

          Allow all SC groups for all protocols.

          If true, \ref protocols is ignored and all the SC groups are allowed.

          This is the default behavior for a workspace that do not have the AVP
          set.
