      Set of aggregation rules for segments.

      In the first step of stop segment mining algorithm, it is sometimes
       necessary to merge some moves or stop together depending on various
       criterion.

       For example, we can be interested in merging consecutive moves together
       to join a stop in a place we find more significant for our study.
