      Classify a date as an absolute time or a relative time or a combination of
      the two.

          The absolute level aggregation slice.

          This is used for finer time slice aggregations.
           For example, if we want to request an aggregation for each 15 minutes,
           the below settings are needed:
             {
                 "absoluteLevel": "MINUTE",
                 "absoluteLevelSlice": 15
             }
        minimum: 2
