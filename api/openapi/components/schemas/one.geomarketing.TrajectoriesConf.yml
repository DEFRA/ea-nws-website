      Trajectories to look for in the segments.

      A trajectory is represented by a set of cells. A move is assimilated to
      a trajectory depending on the Jaccard distance between the cells
      crossed by the move and the cells of the trajectory. The trajectory
      asssociated to the move is the one which have the highest similarity
      with the move.
