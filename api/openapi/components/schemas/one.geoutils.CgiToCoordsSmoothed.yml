      Map cells into coordinates + probability.


      This operation is quite similar to \p CgiToCoords but instead of
      converting

      each cell into a single location, it spreads its output on the whole cell

      coverage.


      For each input cell, it outputs N (coef, coords) couples for which the
      coef

      sum is 1.


      It is recommanded to regroup the data per CGI before applying the
      operation

      because it may produce many points (depending on the resolution), so it

      must be used wisely in order not to produce too much intermediated data.

          Distance between two neighboring points of the output.

          This distance is also the side of an equilateral triangle in the
          triangle sieve that is applied on the circular sector.
