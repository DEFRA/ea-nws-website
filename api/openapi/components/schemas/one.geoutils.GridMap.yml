      Map locations into a grid on Earth's surface.


      A grid is defined by its boundaries and a target square side. Its
      'squares'

      have a constant angular height and a constant angular width but because

      they are not applied on a flat surface, their metric widths (and then

      surface) depends on the latitude.


      Input: location coordinates.


      Output: boundaries of the matched grid square corresponding to the
      location
              (if matched). The output type is \p geoutils.GridSquare. \note The grid is convenient to use for limited areas (country with
      reasonable size). An improved version should be developed and used if we

      start working on bigger areas (continent or continent-like countries).
