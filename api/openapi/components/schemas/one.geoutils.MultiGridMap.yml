      Map locations into a multi-level grid on Earth's surface.

      Instead of mapping locations on a single-level grid (see \p GridMap), this
      mapper applies the mapping at several levels of precision.

      The output type is \p geoutils.MultiGridSquare.
    required:
      - baseSquareSide
      - maxSquareSide
    properties:
      baseSquareSide:
        type: integer
        format: int32
        description: >-
          Side of a square of the grid at the base level of the grid (in meter).


          This value gives the side of the smallest squares of the grid, at
          level

          zero.
        minimum: 1
      maxSquareSide:
        type: integer
        format: int32
        description: >-
          Maximum side of a square of the grid (in meter).


          In order to create the different levels of the grid, the squares are

          going to be merged together: 2x2 squares of level N will be merged to

          create 1 square of level N+1.


          This attribute fixes the limit where we cease creating new levels in

          the grid. \note The square side is calculated near the origin of the
          grid. Some

          located nearer to the edge of the grid can possibly exceed this value.
        minimum: 1
