  nightOffset:
    type: integer

    description: |-
      Night offset for unique days calculation (in second).

      This parameters shifts the time of separation between two days.

      By default, a new day starts at midnight; however, the time of the day
      that marks the separation between the periods of usual human activity
      can be different (eg. in Paris, the metro service closes at 1:15 AM and
      resume at 5:30 AM, so it seems reasonable to use a night offset that
      puts the day change around 3:00 AM).

  minStopDuration:

      Stops with duration below this value are skipped. They are not
