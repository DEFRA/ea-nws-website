      Description of an IOP data stored as a blob.

      If the source is used to store an IOP value as a blob, this field
      can be set to provide details on this storage (IOP type and type of
      storage). Those details might be used in some parts of the product,
      and can be used to validate the data before storing it in the source.
      If unset, no details about what the blob source is storing is provided.
