  Bounded period.

  A bounded period is defined by:

  - an outer range between \p startDate and \p endDate, defining the range
    of time in which the \p period can be defined.

    Note that \p startDate and \p endDate are included in the interval,
    and must be coherent with the \p period unit. For instance, such date
    should be a \ref WeekDate for a \p period with a \ref WeekDatePattern.

  - a period pattern defined by a date pattern and a duration.

  - \p nbOccurrences is the number of successive occurrences of a period
    which may be merged together to define a bigger period.
    For instance, we can define a period as "each 2 hours between 10h and
    20h" with \p nbOccurrences equal to 2. In this case, there are only 5
    occurrences of this period in the defined range instead of 10.
