  Filter field from a single constant value.

  When the field is repeated, the expression evaluates to true if at least
  one value of the array matches the comparison value.

  For example:
  field = [1, 2, 3] and value = 3 => true.
  field = [1, 2, 3] and value = 4 => false.

  However, if the constant value is an array, we will match the whole field
  array as a single value.

  For example:
  field = [1, 2, 3] and value = [1, 2] => false.
  field = [1, 2, 3] and value = [1, 2, 3] => true.
