  Period pattern.

  It is a period which is defined in the context of a bigger period.
  For example, a range [12:30-14:30] is a day period pattern, in
  this case:
   - \p date is \ref DayDatePattern, having 12 as hour, and 30 as minute.
   - \p duration is a \ref Time, having 2 as value and HOUR as unit.

  Note that \p date must be coherent with \p duration unit.
  For instance for a \ref MinuteDatePattern, the \p duration unit
  should be lower than MINUTE, consequently SECOND, or could be MINUTE with a
  duration of 1.
