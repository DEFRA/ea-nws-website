  Date.


  Representation of a date. There are three categories of supported date

  representations:


  - absolute dates expressed as a year, a month, etc; this is the branch from
  \ref platform.YearDate to \ref platform.SecondDate, depending on the
       desired granularity.
  - absolute dates, whose actual value depends on the time it is evaluated;
    this is the \ref platform.RelativeDate class.
  - timestamp date, which is the simplest representation of a point of time;
    this is the \ref platform.TimestampDate class.
