      DynConfSet container for all DynConfSetElem.


      A DynConfSet is a particular version of a \ref DynConf object:

      - the dynamic configuration type name is defined by the field \p
      confTypeName. It must be equal to the static field confTypeName of the
        elements.
      - a DynConfSet contains a set of \ref DynConfSetElem that are the possible
        configurations for the configuration type.
      - each element must have a unique name.

      - a unique provider, usually the core, stores the configurations in files
        and loads them at startup.
