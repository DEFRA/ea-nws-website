      Reference evaluated to the presence of the entity in the control group.


      This reference can be used to check if an entity is present in the control

      group of a scenario or not.


      In case the scenario has no specified control group, the reference always

      evaluates to false.


      In case the scenario has a specified control group, the reference
      evaluates

      to:
           - nil for entities that didn't enter the scenario,
           - true for entities that entered the scenario and are part of the
             control group.
           - false for entities that entered the scenario and are not part of the
             control group.
    properties:
      scenario:
        description: |-
          Id of the scenario.

          If not set, will use the scenario in which the reference is used.
