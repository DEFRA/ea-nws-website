      State of the binlog.


      For active/passive services, the QDB master will push its binlog state in

      RAFT at each commit (or transaction).


      When starting as a master, the QDB library will check its local state

      against the RAFT state. If it is too much in the past

      ( \ref MasterCfg.lateCommitsTolerance), it will refuse to start.


      This prevents an obsolete passive spool to become active, and thus
      override

      up-to-date spools.
