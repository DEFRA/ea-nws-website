      Compression parameter, to control accuracy.

      \ref sigma should be between 0 and 1.

      To increase accuracy you should reduce this parameter. The centroids
      vector length is computed from this value and the memory consumption
      will directly depend on sigma.

      This will also decrease the performance, particularly for ordered input
      data.

      Number of centroids in the buffer: 20 / sigma.
      Size of a centroid: 16 bytes.
      Size of the buffer: 16 * 20 / sigma = 320 / sigma.
      Size of a buffer with default configuration = 64.000 bytes.
    default: 0.005
