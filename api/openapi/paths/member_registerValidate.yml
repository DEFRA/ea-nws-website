  summary: Validate the registration of a new user.
  description: |-
    The user registering a new account should have received a code via
    email or SMS. This RPC is then used to finalize the registration. If
    the registration token is invalid (it has been falsified, it has
    expired, etc), the registration is rejected.
    Once the registration is finalized, an authentication token is
    returned, as the user is considered automatically signed in after
    registration using this token.
    If a device id is provided, a mobile subscription is created if not
    already existing, and the newly created member is linked to this device
    id.
