  summary: Start authentication of a member.
  description: |-
    This RPC is used to authenticate a member based on his email or his
    phone number. Either \ref email or \ref mobilePhone should be set. If
    both are set, \ref mobilePhone is ignored.

    If the email or mobile phone is known, a code is sent to the email
    address, or mobile phone by SMS, and a temporary signin token is
    provided. This token is only valid in \ref signinValidate, to transform
    this signin token into an auth token.
