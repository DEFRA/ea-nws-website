  summary: Validate verification code of a landline phone number.
  description: |-
    This RPC verifies if the auth token is valid, and if the currently
    authenticated user has the provided MSISDN as an unverified landline
    phone number, and if the code matches the expected code. Then the phone
    number is moved to the list of validated phones and removed from the
    unverified numbers.
