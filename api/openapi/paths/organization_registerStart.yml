  summary: Start the registration of a new organization.
  description: >-
    The name of the new organization must be provided, along with the

    initial admin user identified using its email address or mobile phone.

    Either \ref email or \ref mobilePhone should be set. If both are set, \ref
    mobilePhone is ignored. \ref name has a limited maximum length as it comes
    from untrusted

    sources, and should be a reasonable organization name.


    This RPC creates a new organization registration session and sends an

    email or SMS containing a verification code to the email address or

    mobile phone.
