  summary: Validate the registration of a new organization.
  description: |-
    The user registering a new organization should have received a code via
    email or SMS. This function is then used to finalize the registration.
    If the registration token is invalid (it has been falsified, it has
    expired, etc), the registration is rejected.  Once the registration is
    finalized, an authentication token is returned, as the user is
    considered automatically signed in after registration using this token.

    Depending on platform configuration, the new organization may require
    additional validation by platform administrators. In this case, no
    authToken is provided, and the new administrator will not be able to
    sign in.
